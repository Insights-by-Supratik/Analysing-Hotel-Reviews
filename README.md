# Analysing-Hotel-Reviews
The dataset contains customer online reviews for hotels and their corresponding ratings (Likert scale from 1/low to 5/high satisfaction). Randomly, select a sample of 2,000 reviews and based on the new sample, perform topic modelling to separately identify the factors/topics that are discussed in the positive and negative reviews.

In your report you should clearly address and report the following: 
* Explain the criterion used to classify positive and negative reviews. 
* Describe all the steps that are followed for the analysis (for example, tokenization, removal of stop words, etc.).
* Present the criteria for the selection of the number of topics.
* Identify and label the topics.
* Discuss the top three factors that affect the satisfaction of the customers.
* Discuss the top three factors that affect the dissatisfaction of the customers.
